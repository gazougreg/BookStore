# BookStore
Online bookstore with product view, product entry & product search page, in React.
In the home page, the user can choose between searching a book or adding a new one. Then by clicking on the corresponding
icon, the user is directed to the Search or Add a new book page.

## Goals
    * clean code
    * state management 
    * component structural changes
    * DRY-er code
    * performance improvment
    * fix vulnerabilities


## instructions:
 
 1. install Node.js
 
 2. in project's directory run : npm install
 
 3. run: npm start
 You will find the app: http://localhost:3000/
 
## Notes:
-Initially the app contains the books from a given static JSON. However, since those books do not contain all the attributes (eg. categories, rating), it is advised to add a few books for a better experience.

-Unfortunatelly, uploaded images are not properly displayed.

-The book recommendations consist of books that share the same category with the book currently on "Book View".
